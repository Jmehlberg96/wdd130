      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you gotten a cold this year, or maybe you are just feeling sluggish? Do you wish that 
        there was something that is natural and nutritious, that you could make or do to keep that 
        seasonal bug from biting you? I have the perfect place for you to go that will teach you how 
        to take things from nature and turn them into a solution that fights for you. You will learn 
        how to strengthen your immune system when others around you are feeling sick and help your 
        body fight off that bug if it does bite you, so that you can recover quicker. It’s easy, fun, 
        and so worth it to have a healthier immune system. Come and read the testimonials and discover 
        how you can use the elements in nature to keep you and your family healthy and happy. Thomas 
        Adams said “Prevention is so much better than healing, because it saves the labor of being sick.”</p>  <!-- change this -->
