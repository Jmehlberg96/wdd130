        to take things from nature and turn them into a solution that fights for you. You will learn

        Are you ready to learn how you can benefit from the amazing plant world around you? 
        Are you looking to use nature to strengthen and heal your body but you just don’t know where to start? 
        Here you can find your start into the wonderful world of natural health and healing.
      </p>
      <p>

        There are millions of plants, trees, and shrubs all over this beautiful earth that were 
        created for the use of man and animal alike. The necessities of our lives are created from them. 
        From our cotton t-shirts and sheets to our tables, chairs, paper and pencils. Our lives 
        are made better, more comfortable, and very beautiful because of the vegetation that surrounds 
        us. Yet despite all the wonderful things that we can create from nature, the most beneficial 
        thing we get from our wonderful world of plants is LIFE. 
      </p>
      <p>

        Plants have been used since the beginning of time to help the body grow strong and to heal 
        the body when sick. In fact, it wasn’t until the late 1800’s that synthetic aspirin was 
        invented, up until then people used things like peppermint or willow tree bark to help with 
        headaches and pain management. We are extremely grateful for modern medicine and all the 
        amazing things that it can do, but we can’t discount the natural remedies and preventative 
        ways to heal and strengthen our bodies that have worked for millennia. Our bodies were 
        created from the elements of the earth, it just seems logical that the earth is where we should 
        go first for health and strength.

      <h3>Herb Uses</h3>
      <p>

        There are many ways to take a plant and fix it so that it works for you. You can make it into a tincture, a syrup, an infusion (tea), 
        or decoctions. A salve or a poultice might be what you need or even an oil infusion. You can even crush the herbs down to a powder 
        and place them in capsules. Some of them you can cook with or just eat raw. The only problem is deciding what form you need the 
        herb to be in and how soon you need it. Some avenues take longer than others. The key is to be prepared and have them on hand so that 
        the medicine is ready when you need it.
      </p>

      <h4 class="uses">Tinctures</h4>
      <p>

        There are three types of tinctures. Alcohol, vinegar, and glycerin. Each of these is called a menstrum. A menstrum is 
        a liquid used to extract the properties of the plant into the liquid. With an alcohol menstrum, you can extract the most out of 
        the plants. It has the longest shelf life and is absorbed quicker so that you can get the medicine to your systems faster. If you 
        are opposed to alcohol as a base, there are other forms that can be used. Vinegar is the next best thing. Raw apple cider vinegar 
        is the one I prefer to use but others have used white vinegar as well. Vinegar has a shelf life of 3-4 years in a cool dark place. 
        Glycerin is another menstrum that can be used and it has a shelf life of 2 years. A glycerin based syrup keep for 3-6 weeks when 
        refrigerated. Glycerin is sweet and so it makes a good base for kids’ medicine and is a great alternative for alcoholics.
      </p>
      <p>

        To make a simple tincture involves just letting the dried herbs sit in a glass jar in the desired menstrum for 6 weeks and soak. 
        Make sure that your herbs are fully dried and chopped into small pieces. Some recipes are slightly different and involve some cooking, 
        but a simple tincture just needs a good soak. Shake it daily to mix up the herbs and after the soaking process, just strain and label. 
        Keep it in a cool dark place.
      </p>
      <p>

        One of my favorite tinctures to make is a super garlic tincture. It involves a little bit more than just soaking, and takes a bit of time, 
        but is so worth the effort. It is an immune booster like no other. I have used it to fight the cold, flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, 
        sinus infections and just to keep my immune system highly functioning. If you would like to see the step-by-step process, 
        check it out </p><a href="https://smalltownbetties.com/super-garlic-tincture/">here.</a>

      </p>

      <h4 class="uses">Infusions/Decoctions</h4>
      <p>
        Infusions and decoctions are when you use hot water as your menstrum to extract the properties of the herb. You would infuse the more 
        delicate parts of the plant, for instance the flower and leaves, and decoctions are done with the stronger parts of the plant such as 
        the bark or root. Infusions are most common use of herbs. Most people know and understand how to make a cup of tea. All you need 
        to do is boil some water and add in the herbs to soak for 5 min and then strain the herbs out. After you strain the herbs, you can drink 
        it hot or cold. Teas are great for quick medicine but compared to a tincture, you would need to drink a lot of tea to get the same amount 
        of medicinal properties that you would get from just a tablespoon or two of tincture. Infusions also have only about a week shelf life when stored 
        in the fridge so they do not last as long as a tincture. Now a decoction is when you start off by soaking herb and then bringing them to a boil.
        You will need to low boil them for 15 min. Then you strain and drink just like an infusion. To extract the medicinal properties of roots and barks you
        will need to use the decoction method. Decoctions are used in making syrups (see below) like cough and cold syrups.
        Sweeten either with honey or stevia, which is another great herb!
      </p>

      <h4 class="uses">Herbal Oils</h4>
      <p>

        Herbal oils are not only amazing for salads and savory dinners, but they are also essential in healing our bodies. To make 
        an herbal oil is just as simple as a tea or a simple tincture. Choose your favorite natural oil such as olive oil, extra virgin coconut 
        oil, avocado oil, or any seed oil like grapeseed oil. Take your herb, dried and chopped fine, and place it in a wide mouth jar, no need 
        to tightly pack it. Cover the herbs with 2 inches of the oil you chose and put it in a sunny window. Shake it vigorously every day. 
        Depending on how hot it is outside, your oil could be done in a week, but if it is the chilly season, it might take a month. A quicker way 
        is to use a double boiler or a low heat crockpot. You want to get the oil to about 80 – 100 degrees. Remember that heat extracts the medicinal 
        properties. You can double boil it for about 30-45 min or crockpot it for 2-4 hours. When finished, strain the oil through a cheese cloth, label 
        your jar and store in a cool dark place. Herbal oils are used for massages on joint pain or just to relax, ear oils for earaches, baby oils, 
        bug repellants and all kinds of skin disorders. Herbal oils are the base for your homemade salves, ointments, and balms as well.
      </p>

      <h4 class="uses">Salves</h4>
      <p>

        Salves are what you would want to make to apply herbs to the skin. They are useful for burns, rashes, arthritis, eczema, sore muscles, 
        bites, and wounds such as shingles. Salves are easy to make. Just take a cup of your favorite herb oil and warm it with a ¼ cup of bees wax. Add 
        some vitamin E oil to help with rancidity. A little essential oil will also work wonders in your salves. When the wax and oil have melted well 
        together, dip your spoon in the mixture and stick the spoon in the fridge for 5 min. If it is too hard you need to add more oil. If it is too 
        runny, add more bees wax. You want it a soft form but not hard. Be creative and come up with a blend that tickles your senses. 

      </p>

      <h4 class="uses">Pultice</h4>
      <p>
        A pultice is used in first aid when treatment is needed on the spot. Pultices can not be stored because they are made from fresh
        plants or rehydrated dried herbs. Pulitces are used in the treatment of stings, bites, wounds, chest congestion, or even achy joints.
        To make a pultice all you need to do is collect some fresh herbs and grind them up. Fresh herbs are best because the properties are the 
        most potent for a pultice at this time. A mortar and pestle is typically used to crush them up but there are a number of ways that the crushing
        can be accomplished. If you choose to chew the herb to crush it, make sure that it is a safe herb to chew. Once the herb is crushed and the 
        juices from the plant have formed it into a paste like substance, place on infected area and secure with a wrap. The pultice needs to be kept 
        moist, so it will need to be changed frequently. If using dried herbs for a pultice, you need to soak them first in either hot or cold water 
        which will reactivate the properties in the plant. Hot pultices aid in circulation and allow the medicinal properties to reach the cells more 
        quickly. Cold pultices are for the aid in reducing swelling and circulation.

      <h4 class="uses">Syrups</h4>
      <p>
        A simple syrup is just that, simple. Syrups are used for giving medicine to kids and others who may have a harder time swallowing their medicine.
        You know the famous saying, "A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down." All you need to do to make a syrup is to choose the decoction of 
        your choice and add honey. A sweet syrup is a 1:1 ratio and will store longer, up to 6 months in the fridge. If you reduce the honey to a 1:2 ratio, 
        it won't store as long but will still work. Adding tincture to the syrup will improve it's shelf life due to the alcohol in the tincutre. Glycerine
        can also be used to extend the shelf life of a syrup.

      <h3>More Healing</h3>
      <p>Herbs to heal and strengthen your body are not alone in Nature's Pantry. There are many different ways that you can imporve your health. 
        Healing the body needs to be done holistically. When healing you should work not only on your physical health but your mental and spiritual
        health as well. The physical, mental and spiritual parts that make up who you are, are intertwined and can not be separated from each other. 
        If one aspect of yourself is struggling, than it affects the others and they can become sick as well. So if you are working on your physical 
        health, it is always good practice to work on your mental and spiritual health at the same time.
        Here are just a few to consider
      </p>

      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Exercise is essential to your health and wellbeing. When you exercise it releases hormones into your body called endorphins, endocannabinoids, 
        and dopamine that give you what some like to call a "runners high". It is that feeling of euphoria or pleasure that comes after a hard workout.
        Exercise has been clinically proven to not only strengthen you physically but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. When you exercise you have 
        greater power to fight off all kinds of diseases like heart disease and diabetes, but also anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. 
        Exercise has been proven to improve sleep cycles, mood swings, lack of motivation, memory loss, learning disorders, attention and so much more. 
        Exercise reduces stress and can give you more ability to handle stressful situations. It increases oxygen to your brain which improves not only 
        memory, but strengthens your ability to focus and control yourself. Exercise builds self-confidence and improves self-esteem. So, how important
        is exercise for your health? Very important.

      <h3>Meditation</h3>
      <p>
        Meditation has been around for thousands of years. It is the practice of deep breathing and clearing your mind of feelings and emotions. When you
        meditate, you are training your brain to focus. You focus on your breathing, and listening to the air around you. To meditate you find a place 
        where you are comfortable and feel safe. A place that is quiet and allows you to think. Some like to meditate outside in nature. I have loved 
        to do meditation session on the top of a mountain peak after a long hike. I sit in the quiet and listen to my surroundings focusing on my breathing. 
        A great sense of peace and clarity can come when you learn to meditate. Some like to finish their meditation exercise with a prayer of thanksgiving
        for their beautiful life. This will improve your spiritual health along with your mental health. Meditation has been proven to alleviate anxiety, 
        depression, and stress. A daily meditation is recommended for a stronger, healthier, YOU.

      <h4>Massage</h4>
      <p>
        Massage therapy is another form of healing that has been around for thousands of years. It is the practice of soft tissue manipulation to reduce stress,
        improve circulation, aid in healing, boost energy, enhances immune systems, and speed up the body’s own natural healing process, improves mental health and 
        lowers the body's stress levels. The list goes on and on. There are so many benefits to massage therapy that a weekly massage should be on your calendar indefinitely.
        There are different modes of massage that you can benefit from. There is infant massage, sports massage, deep tissue massage, relaxation massage, 
        Shiatsu massage and many, many more. Even a good foot massage, called reflexology, can affect reflex points for your entire body inducing relaxation, 
        toxin release, and relives acute pain. It can initiate labor and the passing of kidney and gallstones. Now, who wants to go get a massage! I do!
