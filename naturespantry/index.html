                        <h2>Welcome To Nature's Pantry</h2>
                        <p>Are you ready to learn how you can benefit from the amazing plant world around you? 
                            Are you looking to use nature to strengthen and heal your body but you just don’t 
                            know where to start? Here you can find your start into the wonderful world of natural 
                            health and healing.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are millions of plants, trees, and shrubs all over this beautiful earth that were 
                            created for the use of man and animal alike. The necessities of our lives are created 
                            from them. From our cotton t-shirts and sheets to our tables, chairs, paper and pencils. 
                            Our lives are made better, more comfortable, and very beautiful because of the vegetation 
                            that surrounds us. Yet despite all the wonderful things that we can create from nature, 
                            the most beneficial thing we get from our wonderful world of plants is LIFE.
                        </p>
                        <p>Plants have been used since the beginning of time to help the body grow strong and to heal 
                            the body when sick. In fact, it wasn’t until the late 1800’s that synthetic aspirin was 
                            invented. Up until then people used things like peppermint or willow tree bark to help with 
                            headaches and pain management. We are extremely grateful for modern medicine and all the 
                            amazing things that it can do, but we can’t discount the natural remedies and preventative 
                            ways to heal and strengthen our bodies that have worked for millennia. Our bodies were created 
                            from the elements of the earth, it just seems logical that the earth is where we should go 
                            first for health and strength.
