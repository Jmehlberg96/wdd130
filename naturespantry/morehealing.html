                Herbs to heal and strengthen your body are not alone in Nature's Pantry. There are many different ways that you can imporve 
                your health. Healing the body needs to be done holistically. When healing you should work not only on your physical health 
                but your mental and spiritual health as well. The physical, mental and spiritual parts that make up who you are, are intertwined 
                and can not be separated from each other. If one aspect of yourself is struggling, than it affects the others and they can become 
                sick as well. So if you are working on your physical health, it is always good practice to work on your mental and spiritual 
                health at the same time. Here are just a few to consider

                        Exercise is essential to your health and wellbeing. When you exercise it releases hormones into your body called 
                        endorphins, endocannabinoids, and dopamine that give you what some like to call a "runners high". It is that feeling 
                        of euphoria or pleasure that comes after a hard workout. Exercise has been clinically proven to not only strengthen 
                        you physically but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. When you exercise you have greater power to fight off all 
                        kinds of diseases like heart disease and diabetes, but also anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems. 
                        Exercise has been proven to improve sleep cycles, mood swings, lack of motivation, memory loss, learning disorders, 
                        attention and so much more. Exercise reduces stress and can give you more ability to handle stressful situations. 
                        It increases oxygen to your brain which improves not only memory, but strengthens your ability to focus and control 
                        yourself. Exercise builds self-confidence and improves self-esteem. So, how important is exercise for your health? 
                        Very important.

                        Meditation has been around for thousands of years. It is the practice of deep breathing and clearing your mind of 
                        feelings and emotions. When you meditate, you are training your brain to focus. You focus on your breathing, and 
                        listening to the air around you. To meditate you find a place where you are comfortable and feel safe. A place that 
                        is quiet and allows you to think. Some like to meditate outside in nature. I have loved to do meditation session on 
                        the top of a mountain peak after a long hike. I sit in the quiet and listen to my surroundings focusing on my breathing. 
                        A great sense of peace and clarity can come when you learn to meditate. Some like to finish their meditation exercise 
                        with a prayer of thanksgiving for their beautiful life. This will improve your spiritual health along with your mental 
                        health. Meditation has been proven to alleviate anxiety, depression, and stress. A daily meditation is recommended for a 
                        stronger, healthier, YOU.

                        Massage therapy is another form of healing that has been around for thousands of years. It is the practice of soft tissue 
                        manipulation to reduce stress, improve circulation, aid in healing, boost energy, enhances immune systems, and speed up the 
                        bodyâ€™s own natural healing process, improves mental health and lowers the body's stress levels. The list goes on and on. There 
                        are so many benefits to massage therapy that a weekly massage should be on your calendar indefinitely. There are different modes 
                        of massage that you can benefit from. There is infant massage, sports massage, deep tissue massage, relaxation massage, Shiatsu 
                        massage and many, many more. Even a good foot massage, called reflexology, can affect reflex points for your entire body inducing 
                        relaxation, toxin release, and relives acute pain. It can initiate labor and the passing of kidney and gallstones. Now, who wants 
                        to go get a massage! I do!
