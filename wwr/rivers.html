                    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>

                <div class="river-paragraph">
                    <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
                    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                    </p>
                    <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
                    sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring 
                    ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
                    from sun or rain when needed.
                    </p>    
                    <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the 
                    longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, 
                    faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
                    There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to 
                    appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="river-paragraph">
                    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green 
                    river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
                    desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from 
                    Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                    interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great 
                    whitewater opportunities. You will have the opportunity to camp along side the river, although 
                    this is on a first come first serve basis. The river usually peaks around 20,000 CFS toward the end of
                    May or early June and recedes throughout the summer and fall to less than 3,000 CFS. The different
                    water levels create their own set of challenges on the river. Our highly qualified staff will
                    be able to navigate and guide you to a wonderful and exciting experience on this river.
                    </p>
                    <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                    </p>
                    <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the 
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.
                    </p>
                    <p> Unfortunately, dogs are NOT allowed in this canyon. So please leave your pup at home.</p>

                    <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
                    rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most 
                    people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
