        <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
            <p>I am so excited to be in this class. I am a mother of 5 amazing kids, two of which are helping us from the other side.
            I have been married to my best friend for 26 years in May. I love to hike, bike, quilt, watch movies, spend time with my kids, cook, garden and so much more. 
            I have a great love for the gospel of Jesus Christ. I love the scriptures and love to teach the scriptures. I have been
            a member of the Chruch of Jesus Christ my whole life and have been so blessed with parents who taught me the gospel from a young age.
            I currently live in Gilbert, Arizona but have moved around a lot. My favorite place I have lived is Gallatin, Missouri.
            We raised our kids there and that is where we grew the most spiritully. Our plan is to live closer to our married kids who 
            will someday, we hope, have kids of thier own that we can spoil.</p>

        <p>I am getting my degree in Applied Technology and a fouth certificate on Graphic Design. I love 
            learning about technology and how it can make our lives so much more efficiant. I can see the hand of God
            in the technology that has been given to us and how it furthers His work. I want to be a part of that. I want to be able to 
            teach the gospel through technology and bless the lives of His children. I have built websites in the past and currently run one for 
            my business. I built it with a website builder, so I had a lot of help. My goal is to be able to learn how to run it better and build it
            up so that it can serve a greater purpose. If you want to check it out, here it is. <a href="https://smalltownbetties.com/">SmallTownBetties.com</a></p>
